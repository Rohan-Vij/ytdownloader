# ytdownloader
Some simple Python programs using the pytube package to download videos.
**`ytdownloader_playlist.py` is not working due to a problem with the pytube package itself. Please let me know if you have found a workaround or solution!**

### Required Modules
The only module required so far is pytube:
`pip install pytube`
or
`pip3 install pytube`
